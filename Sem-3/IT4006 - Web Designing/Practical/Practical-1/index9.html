	<p align="justify">A peacock is a shiny blue bird who fans out his large colorful iridescent tail feathers, especially when he's flirting with the peahens. A peacock is a male peafowl. A male peacock is more flamboyant than his female counterpart â€” he's the one with those long brilliant tail feathers marked with eye-like designs.</p>
